# 7-Card-Stud-Poker

### About
This project was built for CSC-120 / Programming on Purpose. This course taught the fundamentals of what it means to write "good" software or "clean" software. The game was built for completion of Project 4 in the course.

#### Project description
*You will continue modeling the game of poker, but we're going to make a version that's closer to the popular Texas Hold'em. This will entail one main difference: Instead of 5-card poker hands, we will have community cards (five cards that all hands can use) and hole cards (2-card stud poker hands) from which to make the best possible 5-card hand.*

### Java
Contained in the Java code is fully battle tested and well-written code, designed to be modular and efficient. I implemented the code to be as robust as possible, so a change in something like how I store the Cards won't break the rest of the codebase.

### CSC-120
CSC-120 covered the following topics
-   iterative development
-   refactoring
-   helper functions
-   top-down design
-   information hiding
-   formal testing
-   debugging techniques
-   code efficiency
-   recursive techniques
-   OOP basics: classes, constructors, instance variables
